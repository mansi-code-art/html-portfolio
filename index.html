    <h2><u><i>Instructions</i> </u></h2>
    <h3>For the Cake </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven: Preheat your oven to 350Â°F (175Â°C). Grease and flour two 9inch round cake pans or line them
            with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Mix dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. </li>
        <li> Cream butter and sugar: In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together using a hand or stand mixer on
            medium speed until light and fluffy (about 3â€“4 minutes). </li>
        <li> Add eggs and vanilla: Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the
            next. Mix in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li> Alternate dry and milk: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture in three additions,
            alternating with the milk. Start and end with the dry ingredients. Mix just until combined.</li>
        <li> Divide and bake: Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for 30â€“35 minutes, or until a
            toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li> Cool: Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3> For the Frosting: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat butter: In a large bowl, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy (about 2 minutes). </li>
        <li> Add powdered sugar: Gradually add the powdered sugar, beating on low speed until fully combined. </li>
        <li>Mix in vanilla and cream: Add the vanilla, heavy cream, and salt. Beat on high speed for 3â€“4 minutes, until
            the frosting is light and fluffy. Adjust consistency with more cream if needed. </li>


    </ol>


    <h3>Assemble the Cake </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Place one cake layer on a serving plate or stand. Spread a layer of frosting evenly on top.</li>
        <li> Add the second cake layer and spread frosting over the top and sides.</li>
        <li> Decorate as desired with sprinkles, fruit, or piping. </li>
    </ul>





    <h3> Tips </h3>
    <li> For extra moistness, brush the cake layers with simple syrup (equal parts sugar and water heated until
        dissolved).</li>
    <li> Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. </li>
    <ul></ul>
